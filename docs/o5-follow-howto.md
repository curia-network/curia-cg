Perfect, thanks for the thorough answers. I’ll put together a complete implementation strategy for integrating a conditional LSP26 Follow button that fits your existing architecture, including transaction handling, UI/UX behavior, and state updates.

I’ll get back to you shortly with the full strategy.


# Implementing a LUKSO LSP26 "Follow" Button for Universal Profiles

## LSP26 Follow Transaction Flow (Universal Profile Following)

Implementing a follow action on LUKSO involves interacting with the **LSP26 Follower System** smart contract. The LSP26 standard provides a registry contract (deployed at the official address `0xf01103E5a9909Fc0DBe8166dA7085e0285daDDcA` on LUKSO mainnet) that manages follow relationships on-chain. To follow a Universal Profile (UP), your application will execute the LSP26 contract’s `follow(address addr)` function, where `addr` is the target profile’s address. The key points in the transaction flow are:

1. **Ensure Wallet Connection:** First, confirm the user is connected to their Universal Profile wallet (via the browser extension). If `userStatus.connected` is false, prompt the user to connect their UP wallet, because the follow action must be initiated by the user’s profile account.

2. **Prepare the Contract Call:** Create an ethers Contract instance for the LSP26 Registry using its ABI and address. Make sure to connect it with the signer representing the user’s Universal Profile. In LUKSO, a Universal Profile is a smart contract account, so the follow transaction should originate from the UP itself (the **msg.sender** needs to be the UP address that will follow the target). Typically, this means using the UP’s Key Manager (LSP6) to execute the call. For example, your `followProfile()` function in `@/lib/lsp26.ts` might internally do something like: encode the `follow(targetUP)` call data and invoke the UP’s `execute(...)` method to call the LSP26 contract. This ensures the **Universal Profile contract** is the caller of `LSP26.follow()` (so that the registry records the UP as the follower). In code, the flow could be:

   ```typescript
   // Pseudocode for followProfile
   const LSP26_ADDRESS = "<LSP26Registry_contract_address>";
   const lsp26Contract = new ethers.Contract(LSP26_ADDRESS, LSP26_ABI, signer);
   const targetAddress = requirement.target;  // the UP to follow
   // Encode the follow call data
   const followData = lsp26Contract.interface.encodeFunctionData('follow', [targetAddress]);
   // Execute via the user's Universal Profile contract (to ensure msg.sender is the UP)
   const upContract = new ethers.Contract(userProfileAddress, UniversalProfileABI, signer);
   const tx = await upContract.execute(OPERATIONS.CALL, LSP26_ADDRESS, 0, followData);
   ```

   In practice, if the LUKSO browser extension is handling the Universal Profile, you might also be able to call `lsp26Contract.connect(signer).follow(targetAddress)` directly. The extension will intercept this and have the UP execute the call under the hood. The important part is that the transaction originates from the UP’s address (not just the controller EOA) so that the LSP26 registry logs the correct follower. The LSP26Registry will then update its storage to list the user’s UP as following the target, and emit a `Follow(follower, addr)` event.

3. **User Confirmation:** When `followProfile()` is invoked, it will prompt the wallet extension to confirm the transaction (just like any token transfer or on-chain interaction). The user will see a confirmation dialog with details (including the gas fee). They must approve this for the transaction to be signed and broadcast. This step is handled by the Universal Profile browser extension seamlessly, similar to MetaMask flow. Your app just needs to await the promise for the transaction. At this stage, set some **loading state** in your UI (e.g. `isFollowingPending = true`) to indicate the action is in progress.

4. **Transaction Broadcast and Mining:** Once the user confirms, the transaction is sent to the LUKSO network. You should wait for the transaction to be mined by calling `await tx.wait()` on the returned transaction object. While waiting, keep the UI in a pending state (e.g. disable the Follow button and show a spinner or “Following…” text). The app can also listen for the `Follow` event from the LSP26 contract as additional confirmation, but simply waiting for the receipt is usually sufficient. The LSP26 standard also triggers a Universal Receiver callback on the target profile when it gains a follower, but you do not need to handle that for this client-side workflow.

5. **Post-Transaction Update:** If the transaction succeeds (mined with status 1), the user’s profile is now following the target. Your app should update the requirement status to **met**. Typically, this means setting `requirementMet = true` for the “must\_follow” requirement and re-rendering the UI to reflect the new status. You might remove or replace the Follow button with a success indicator (like a checkmark or “Following” label). This **automatic refresh** of the requirement status can be done by calling your `getFollowingStatus()` (which likely wraps `LSP26.isFollowing(follower, target)`) to double-check the updated state, or by optimistic update (since we know it succeeded). In summary, the flow is: **connect wallet → click Follow → sign transaction → wait for success → update state**.

## Gas Estimation and User Confirmation in React

Handling gas fees and user confirmation is similar to other Ethereum-style transactions, with some nuances for UX:

* **Gas Estimation:** Before sending the follow transaction, it’s good practice to estimate the gas required. You can use ethers.js to estimate gas for the call, for example: `const gasEstimate = await lsp26Contract.estimateGas.follow(targetAddress)`. This helps catch errors early (for instance, if the call would fail or if the user has insufficient LYX for gas). In most cases, you can rely on the provider to automatically estimate gas when sending the transaction, but doing it manually allows you to add a safety margin (e.g., multiply by 1.1) to avoid gas underestimation. In your React code, you might do something like:

  ```typescript
  const gasLimit = (await lsp26Contract.estimateGas.follow(targetAddress)).mul(110).div(100); 
  const tx = await lsp26Contract.follow(targetAddress, { gasLimit });
  ```

  If your `followProfile()` abstraction handles this internally, ensure it includes gas estimation logic. By confirming the gas in advance, you also have an opportunity to inform the user about the expected fee, although the wallet extension itself will show the gas cost on the confirmation screen.

* **User Confirmation Dialog:** Once `follow()` is called on the contract (or the UP’s `execute` is called), the Universal Profile browser extension will pop up a confirmation dialog. From the app’s perspective, this call returns a Promise that will **pause** until the user approves or rejects. During this time, set a React state like `isTxPending=true` and perhaps show a message like “Waiting for confirmation…”. The user’s action will resolve the Promise:

  * If the user **approves**, you’ll get a Transaction object back. At that moment, you can update the UI to “Transaction submitted...” while you wait for it to mine.
  * If the user **rejects** the confirmation (e.g. closes the dialog or clicks cancel), ethers will throw an error (such as *"User denied transaction signature"*). Your code should catch this and handle it by clearing the loading state and perhaps showing a gentle notice (e.g. “Follow request canceled”). In this case, no transaction is sent.

* **During Mining:** After the user confirms, the transaction is in the mempool/mining process. The wallet extension will typically show this as pending. In your React app, you should keep the Follow button disabled and in a loading state during this period. You might also integrate an optional **transaction link** (for example, a link to a LUKSO explorer) so users can view the pending transaction externally – if so, use the sandbox’s `cgInstance.navigate(url)` to open it safely. However, this is optional; many apps simply show a spinner until done. Since your environment is sandboxed, any external link (like a blockchain explorer) should indeed use `cgInstance.navigate()`.

* **Gas Payment:** As noted, the user will pay the gas fee for this follow transaction (consistent with your existing token verification flows). Ensure the UI communicates that a blockchain transaction is happening (so the user isn’t surprised by a gas fee prompt). The extension’s confirmation dialog will show the gas cost in LYX. No special gas sponsorship is implemented (you’ve confirmed you are not doing gasless transactions), so just make sure the user has enough LYX in their UP’s account. If needed, you might check `signer.getBalance()` beforehand to warn if their balance is very low.

In summary, integrate gas estimation in your transaction call for reliability, and leverage the wallet’s UI for user confirmation. Manage React state so that from click -> confirmation -> mining -> completion, the user is kept informed of what’s happening (e.g., button states and messages).

## Checking Follow Status Before Showing the Button

Yes – you should definitely check the current follow status before rendering or enabling the "Follow" button. This prevents unnecessary transactions and provides a correct UI from the start. There are a couple of ways to do this, and it sounds like you already have some of it in place:

* **Pre-check via Requirement Status:** Your app likely computes `requirementMet` for each requirement type when loading the gated content. For a `"must_follow"` requirement, you can use your `getFollowingStatus()` helper (which probably calls the LSP26 contract’s `isFollowing(follower, target)` function). For example, `isFollowing(userProfileAddress, requiredProfileAddress)` returns true if the user’s UP is already following the target. This check can happen on page load or when the requirements are fetched. If it returns true, set `requirementMet=true` for that requirement. In the UI (e.g. in `RichRequirementsDisplay`), you would then show a completed status (like a checkmark or simply no action needed).

* **Conditional Rendering:** Only show the "Follow" action button if the requirement is not met. For example:

  ```jsx
  { !requirementMet && requirement.type === 'must_follow' && (
       <ActionButton onClick={handleFollowClick}>Follow</ActionButton>
  )}
  ```

  If `requirementMet` is true (user already follows the profile), you might display a label like "Already following" or just mark the requirement as verified.

* **Real-time Verification:** It’s wise to double-check the follow status *just before* initiating a follow transaction as well. There’s a chance the data could have changed (perhaps the user followed the profile from another app or a different session). You could call `isFollowing` again when rendering the button or when the user clicks it. This prevents sending a redundant transaction if somehow the user already follows the target. (The LSP26 contract might reject or no-op if already following, but it’s better to avoid sending the tx at all.)

* **After Following:** Similarly, once a follow transaction succeeds, update the state. You can call `isFollowing` again to verify it returns true now. This confirms the requirement is fulfilled and will update `requirementMet` to true, which in turn will remove or change the Follow button in the UI.

By checking the status upfront, the UI remains accurate and you avoid showing a Follow button when it’s not needed. This check is inexpensive (just a view call on the contract) and can be done as part of your requirements fetching logic.

## Managing Transaction Success and Failure States

Handling the aftermath of the transaction is crucial for a smooth UX. Your app should respond appropriately whether the follow succeeds or fails:

* **During Transaction (Pending State):** As mentioned, set a pending state when the user initiates the follow. For example, `setFollowPending(true)`. Visually, the Follow button can be disabled and show a loading spinner or text like “Following…”. This prevents multiple clicks and indicates progress. You likely have a similar pattern for your marketplace "Get" buttons (e.g., a loading state while an external link is opening or a purchase is pending).

* **On Success (Follow Confirmed):** Once `tx.wait()` resolves with a success, you have confirmation that the follow is on-chain. At this point:

  * **Update Requirement Status:** Mark the “must\_follow” requirement as met. If you maintain a list of requirements in state, update that entry’s status. If using context or a state management store, dispatch an update. This will trigger your UI (RichRequirementsDisplay) to re-render and show the requirement as completed (likely a green check or similar). Because the requirement is now satisfied, the Follow button should disappear (or be replaced by a non-clickable indicator).
  * **Success Feedback:** Provide clear feedback to the user that the action succeeded. Simply seeing the requirement turn green may be enough. Additionally, you could show a temporary message like a toast notification: “You are now following \[Profile Name]!” as positive reinforcement. This is similar to a success message after verifying a token.
  * **Reset Loading State:** Set `isFollowPending` back to false. If you have a separate state for success (like `hasFollowed=true`), you can set that, but often just updating the requirement status and clearing the pending flag is sufficient.
  * The change in follow status is also recorded in the LSP26Registry’s storage (so `isFollowing` will return true going forward) and a `Follow` event was emitted. If you have any event listeners or need to update other parts of the app (perhaps a follower count or profile relation), you can handle that here as well.

* **On Failure:** There are a few failure scenarios to handle gracefully:

  * **User Rejection:** If the user cancels the transaction in the wallet, catch this error. In this case, no on-chain action occurred, so just inform the user politely or simply reset the UI state. For example, you might display a small note like “Follow action canceled.” or even no message (since cancellation is user-initiated). Ensure the Follow button becomes active again (so they can click it if they change their mind).
  * **Transaction Revert/Failure:** If the transaction was sent but **failed on-chain** (e.g., out of gas, or the Key Manager rejected it, etc.), then `tx.wait()` might return a receipt with `status === 0` (failure) or throw an error. This could happen if, say, the user’s profile lacked permission to call the LSP26 contract (unlikely if configured correctly), or if they tried to follow an address they’re already following and the contract disallowed duplicate follows. In such cases:

    * Clear the loading state (`isFollowPending=false`).
    * Show an error message to the user. Make it user-friendly, e.g., “Transaction failed. Please try again or check your wallet.” If you can detect the reason (via the error message or a custom error code), tailor it. For instance, an **“out of gas” or “insufficient funds”** error should prompt the user to top up their balance before retrying.
    * Leave the Follow button available so they can attempt again after addressing the issue. If the error is due to already following, then refresh the status and you’ll find `requirementMet=true` (meaning despite the error, they are actually following), in which case update the UI accordingly.
  * **Network Issues:** Handle cases where the transaction might be stuck or the promise not resolving in a timely manner (e.g., network congestion). It’s good practice to have a timeout or the ability for the user to retry. If a tx is pending for a long time, you might let the user know they can check the network or retry. However, generally on LUKSO the traffic is manageable and this may not be a big concern.

* **Insufficient Funds Edge Case:** Since the user pays gas, if they don’t have enough LYX, the transaction won’t go through. This might be caught at the wallet confirmation (the extension may prevent sending if funds are too low) or result in a revert. To improve UX:

  * You could pro-actively check the user’s balance (`signer.getBalance()`) against an estimated gas cost. If balance is too low, warn them (e.g., “Not enough LYX to pay for gas. Please fund your account and try again.”) and possibly disable the Follow button until they have funds.
  * If the transaction fails due to insufficient gas after sending, treat it as a failure: inform the user and guide them to acquire more LYX. You might integrate a `cgInstance.navigate()` link to a faucet or exchange if appropriate in your context.

* **State Management:** Encapsulate these state transitions in your component’s state or a Redux store (depending on your app). For example, you might have:

  ```jsx
  const [isFollowPending, setFollowPending] = useState(false);
  const [followError, setFollowError] = useState<string|null>(null);
  ```

  Use these to control the UI. On click, clear any old error, set pending true; in the try/catch of the async tx call, handle success (no error, pending false) or catch (pending false, set error message). Then in JSX, you can display `followError` if present (e.g., as a red text under the button) and use `isFollowPending` to disable the button and show a spinner.

By handling success and failure cleanly, your app will feel responsive and reliable. The goal is that after a successful follow, the UI reflects the new state without requiring a manual refresh, and after a failed attempt, the user knows what to do next.

## UX Considerations for the Follow Button

Designing the Follow button’s UX should align with your existing app style and be intuitive. Here are the best practices and considerations:

* **Conditional Display & Wording:** Only show the **“Follow”** button when it’s needed (i.e., the requirement is not yet met and the user is identified). If the user must follow a specific profile as a prerequisite, make sure it’s clear *which* profile that is. For example, the requirement line might read “Must follow Universal Profile XYZ” and the button simply says “Follow”. If possible, include the profile’s name or icon next to the button to give context on who they are about to follow (especially if multiple follow requirements exist). Since you’re in a token gating context, presumably the requirement text already names the profile.

* **Visual Style & Icons:** Use the same button style as your other action buttons (like the marketplace “Get” buttons) for consistency. If those have icons (perhaps an external link icon for “Get”), you might use a relevant icon for follow (maybe a “+” or a user icon). However, keep it simple and recognizable – a plain “Follow” text is usually clear enough. Maintain the sizing, padding, and disabled styles consistent with the rest of your UI components.

* **Loading State:** As discussed, show a loading indicator when the follow is in progress. This could be a spinner inside the button or a subtle animation. The text could change to “Following…” or the button could show just a spinner with the original width preserved (to avoid layout shift). Ensure that during loading the button is disabled to avoid duplicate clicks.

* **Success State:** After a successful follow, you have a few UX options:

  * **Remove the Button:** The simplest approach is to stop rendering the Follow button because the requirement is now met. The requirement display might then just show a checkmark or “Followed” status. This immediately indicates success.
  * **Temporary Confirmation:** Optionally, you could replace the button with a non-interactive label like “Followed ✓” for a short time or permanently. This reinforces that the action is completed. If your design shows a list of requirements with their statuses, turning the status to verified (green or checked) is often enough feedback.
  * **Toasts/Notifications:** As mentioned earlier, a toast message saying “You have followed \[Profile] successfully!” can be a nice touch, especially if other parts of the app update asynchronously.
  * **No Auto-Unfollow UI:** Since the requirement is to follow, you likely do **not** want to offer an “Unfollow” button in this context (unfollowing would immediately make the requirement fail again). Thus, the post-success state should not encourage reversal. If anything, the user would have to manually go elsewhere to unfollow, and your gating logic would catch that and revert access if they did. But in the context of gating, assume they will keep it followed.

* **Error Feedback:** If an error occurs, make the feedback clear and actionable:

  * Display error messages in-line near the button or as a toast. Use plain language like “Transaction failed: \[reason]”.
  * If the error is fixable (low funds, etc.), guide the user (e.g., “Please add some LYX to your profile and try again.”).
  * Ensure that the error message can be dismissed or will disappear upon retry (you don’t want a stale error lingering after the user has corrected the issue and clicked follow again).

* **Use of cgInstance.navigate:** Since you’re in a sandboxed environment, any external links (for example, viewing the target profile or getting LYX) should use `cgInstance.navigate(url)`. The Follow action itself is on-chain, so it doesn’t require an external web link (unlike your token “Get” buttons which presumably navigated to an external marketplace or faucet). However, you might consider adding an info icon or the profile name as a link that opens the target’s Universal Profile page via `cgInstance.navigate` in case the user wants to see who they are about to follow. This would be a nice UX touch: e.g., requirement line “Must follow **Alice’s Profile**” where **Alice’s Profile** is clickable (opening profile.lukso or your own profile viewer).

* **Disabled State when Not Connected:** If the user hasn’t connected their wallet, you could still show the requirement but have the Follow button either hidden or disabled with a tooltip “Connect your Universal Profile to follow”. Since `userStatus.connected` tells you the connection status, incorporate that: e.g.,

  ```jsx
  {!userStatus.connected ? (
      <ActionButton disabled title="Connect wallet to follow">Follow</ActionButton>
    ) : (
      <ActionButton onClick={handleFollowClick}>Follow</ActionButton>
    )
  }
  ```

  Alternatively, if your UI flow requires connection first anyway, you might not render requirements at all until connected. In any case, ensure the user can’t attempt to follow without a wallet connection.

* **Accessibility & Feedback:** Make sure button states are distinguishable (e.g., a disabled button looks different) and consider adding an ARIA live region for status updates (so screen readers can announce “Follow successful” or “Transaction pending” for accessibility). Keep text short and clear on the button due to its likely small size in a list.

By aligning the Follow button’s UX with your existing patterns and providing immediate feedback, users will find the experience seamless. Essentially, it should **feel like a native part of your requirement verification flow** – just as smooth as your token verification (but initiating an on-chain follow instead of an external link).

## Integration with the Universal Profile Wallet Connection

Integrating the follow feature with your existing wallet connection infrastructure is straightforward since you already handle transactions in the app. Key integration points:

* **Using the Existing Provider/Signer:** Reuse the ethers provider and signer that were established when the user connected their Universal Profile. For example, if you used `new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum)` and then `provider.getSigner()` to get the connected signer, use that signer for the LSP26 contract call. This signer is actually a **JsonRpcSigner** from the UP browser extension, which is capable of orchestrating transactions on behalf of the UP. Ensure that this signer is passed into your `followProfile()` function or available in that module. In code, it might look like:

  ```typescript
  import { followProfile } from '@/lib/lsp26';
  // ...
  const signer = provider.getSigner(); 
  await followProfile(targetAddress, signer);
  ```

  Behind the scenes, this will prompt the UP extension as discussed. The critical part is that you do not create a new provider or signer from scratch – use the one tied to the user’s session so that it has the correct connected account (the user’s UP).

* **Accessing the User’s Profile Address:** You likely store the connected Universal Profile’s address in state (perhaps `userStatus.profileAddress` or similar). This address might also be obtainable via `signer.getAddress()`. Use it if needed, for example when calling `isFollowing(userProfile, targetProfile)`. The LSP26 `isFollowing` check doesn’t require the signer (it can be a static call), but it needs the addresses. So make sure you know the user’s UP address from the connection. Typically, after connecting, `provider.listAccounts()` or `getSigner().getAddress()` will return the UP’s address (the extension manages this for you). Double-check that – if it returns an EOA controller instead, you might need to fetch the UP address from extension-specific methods, but given the extension’s design it should expose the UP as the account.

* **Network Configuration:** Ensure the provider is connected to the LUKSO network (L14 testnet or LUKSO mainnet, depending on where your app is running) so that it can interact with the LSP26 contract at the known address. Since you mentioned using the mainnet LSP26 deployment, make sure the user’s extension is on LUKSO mainnet. You might have logic in place to detect the wrong network and prompt a switch, reuse that for this feature.

* **Permission and Key Manager:** Given that your app already executes transactions via the UP, the user’s Universal Profile likely has a Key Manager (LSP6) that grants the controller address the permission to CALL external contracts. This is typically default, but if a profile had restrictions, the follow transaction would fail. Assuming normal conditions, integration is smooth. Just be aware: if a follow transaction fails consistently, it might be due to missing permissions on the UP (e.g., the controller doesn’t have `CALL` permission). In such a rare case, the user would need to update their UP permissions. You don’t necessarily need to handle this in code beyond showing the error, but it’s something to keep in mind if you encounter unexplained reverts.

* **State Management Integration:** Your `userStatus` (which tracks `.connected`) could be extended to track follow relationships if needed, but it’s probably not necessary. Instead, after a follow, just update the specific requirement’s state. If you have a global store of the user’s social connections (less likely), you could add the new follow there too. However, since this is a gating requirement, treating it as a one-off check is fine.

* **Testing in Sandbox:** Because you’re in a sandboxed environment (likely an iframe within a larger app), test that the wallet connection and transaction prompt flow still works with the Follow button. It should, as it’s using the same `cgInstance.navigate` pattern only if an external link is needed (which for the transaction itself, it is not). The only external calls are to the blockchain via the injected provider, which is allowed. So integration-wise, nothing special is needed except using the same patterns.

In summary, **leverage your existing wallet connection and transaction handling logic**. The Follow button becomes just another kind of transaction the user can perform, so it should slot into your app’s architecture similarly to how token verification transactions (if any) are handled. By doing so, you maintain consistency and reduce the chance of new bugs.

## Robust Error Handling and Edge Cases

Finally, consider error handling for edge cases to make your implementation robust:

* **Insufficient LYX:** As discussed, if the user doesn’t have enough LYX, inform them early. You might integrate a balance check when the component mounts or when the follow button is clicked. This can prevent frustrating failures. Optionally, provide a link to a guide on obtaining LYX or a faucet (using `cgInstance.navigate`).

* **Follow Limit or Self-Follow:** The LSP26 standard likely prevents following yourself, but your UI should also hide or disable following if the target address equals the user’s address (that scenario might not even come up in requirements). Just in case, don’t show a follow button for self-follow requirements (or any invalid target).

* **Multiple Follow Actions:** If by any chance your app allows multiple follow requirements or multiple follow operations in a short time, queue them properly. Don’t allow starting a second follow transaction while one is pending (this is naturally handled by the pending state). If there are two different profiles the user must follow, they have to do them one by one. After each success, update that requirement’s status. The wallet extension can handle sequential tx prompts, but the user might be confused by multiple popups, so it’s better to require one at a time.

* **Fallback and Retries:** In case of a network failure or unexpected error (e.g., JSON RPC error), allow the user to retry the action. For example, if the `followProfile()` promise rejects due to a transient error, surface it (maybe “Network error, please try again”) and keep the button active for another attempt.

* **Logs and Monitoring:** It’s good practice to log the outcome (success or error) for debugging. Since you have a sandbox environment, ensure any console logs or error messages don’t get swallowed. This helps during development and QA.

By anticipating these issues, you can handle them gracefully and maintain a good user experience even when things go wrong.

---

**In summary**, to implement the Follow button using LSP26: **check the follow status, provide a button that triggers an LSP26 `follow()` transaction via the user’s Universal Profile, handle the wallet confirmation and transaction lifecycle with loading and success states, and update the UI once the follow is confirmed.** Thanks to LSP26, the follow action is a standardized on-chain operation, and with your existing wallet integration on LUKSO, the process will be very similar to other transactions in your app. By paying attention to state management and UX details, the follow feature will feel like a natural extension of your token gating system, enhancing it with social requirements. Good luck with the implementation!
